            <p class="lead  ">Temperature measurement units developed over time. In ancient times, people estimated heat
                and cold only by their personal feelings. This method was not accurate, and each person’s judgment was
                different. With the progress of science, the need for accurate temperature measurement was realized. For
                this purpose, thermometers were invented and standard units were introduced. Scales like Fahrenheit and
                Celsius are the result of these efforts. These units made temperature measurement more reliable and
                easier...</p>

                    <h1>Ounce (oz)</h1>
                    <h3 style="margin-top: 26px;">What is a Ounce?</h3>
                    <p class="card-text">The ounce (oz) is a unit of mass used in the British imperial and United States
                        customary systems of measurement. One ounce equals exactly 1/16 of a pound (avoirdupois) or
                        approximately 28.35 grams. The ounce is the standard unit for measuring food ingredients in
                        American recipes, deli portions, postal packages, baby weight gain, and small retail items. It
                        provides a convenient middle ground between pounds (too large) and fractions (too complex) for
                        everyday cooking and commerce. Note: The weight ounce (oz) is completely different from the
                        fluid ounce (fl oz), which measures volume.</p>
                    <h1>History of the Ounce</h1>

                    <p>The ounce is one of the oldest units of mass and has its roots in ancient civilizations. It
                        originated from the Roman unit called uncia, which meant one-twelfth of a Roman pound. Over
                        time, the ounce spread across Europe and was used in trade and daily measurements. Different
                        regions developed their own versions, but the most common today is the avoirdupois ounce, used
                        in countries like the United Kingdom and the United States, where 1 ounce equals 28.35 grams.
                        The ounce is still widely used for measuring food, precious metals, and small quantities, making
                        it an important unit in modern life.

                    <h3 style="margin-top: 26px;">What is a Gram?</h3>
                    <p class="card-text">The gram (g) is a unit of mass in the metric system equal to one-thousandth of
                        a kilogram (1/1000 kg or 0.001 kg). The gram is the universal standard for measuring small
                        masses—from food ingredients and nutrition labels to medication dosages and precious metals.
                        While the kilogram is the official SI base unit for mass, grams dominate everyday life worldwide
                        because they provide convenient whole-number measurements without requiring decimal points for
                        typical cooking, postal, and scientific applications. One gram equals exactly 1,000 milligrams
                        or approximately 0.035 ounces.</p>
                    <h1>History of the Gram</h1>

                    <p>The gram was introduced as part of the original French metric system developed during the French
                        Revolution in the 1790s. The name derives from the Late Latin "gramma," meaning "small weight."
                        Initially, the gram was defined as the mass of one cubic centimeter (1 cm³) of pure water at its
                        maximum density (approximately 4°C). This water-based definition made the metric system
                        elegantly interconnected: 1 gram of water occupies 1 cubic centimeter and equals 1 milliliter.
                        In 1795, France officially adopted the metric system. The modern definition, established with
                        the 2019 SI redefinition, defines the gram through the kilogram, which is now defined by the
                        Planck constant rather than a physical prototype.

                    <p class="card-text">The pound (lb) is a unit of mass in the imperial and United States customary
                        systems, defined as exactly 0.45359237 kilograms. It serves as the standard measurement for body
                        weight, groceries, and everyday objects in American life, from bathroom scales to supermarket
                        pricing.</p>
                    <h1>History of the Pound</h1>

                    <p>The pound originates from the ancient Roman libra (hence the symbol "lb"), a unit of weight equal
                        to approximately 329 grams. The avoirdupois pound emerged in 13th-century England for commercial
                        trade, standardized at 16 ounces. In 1959, the international pound was precisely defined as
                        0.45359237 kilograms through international agreement, creating exact alignment between imperial
                        and metric systems while preserving the traditional 16-ounce division.

                    <h1>History of the Milligram</h1>

                    <p>The milligram emerged as a practical subdivision of the gram when the metric system was
                        formalized in the late 18th century. Its importance grew dramatically with the advancement of
                        pharmaceutical science in the 19th and 20th centuries, as precise medication dosing became
                        critical for patient safety. Today it remains the standard unit for drug dosages worldwide.
